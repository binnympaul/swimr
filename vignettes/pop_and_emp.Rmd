I have been tasked with coming up with a convenient method for digesting the 
results of a SWIM model run. I think the best thing to do is to create a series
of helper functions that will create plots or calculate metrics on tables pulled
directly from the database. I have wrapped these functions in an Rpackage that
I am calling `swimr`. As yet, this package is in a git repository on 
my computer, but I can throw it on GitHub when I'm given a private space for it,
or told it can be public.

# Scenario Description

`r rtab("scenario")` shows the scenario information. 
In this report we will focus on `r facet`-level aggregations for 
`r facet_levels`. The report also provides MPO-level aggregations for all MPO's.

```{r scenario, results='asis'}
# update to reflect current scenario
scen_info <- data_frame(
  Name = c("Reference", "Current"),
  Scenario = c(basename(ref_db), basename(cur_db)),
  `File Date` = c(file.info(ref_db)$mtime, file.info(cur_db)$mtime)
)

kable(scen_info, caption = "Scenario Information")
```


# Population and Employment

```{r se}
se <- left_join(
  extract_se(db1, "MPO") %>% rename(reference = y),
  extract_se(db2, "MPO") %>% rename(current   = y)
) %>%
  filter(year %in% years) %>%
  mutate(diff = (current - reference) / reference * 100)
```

`r rtab("tab_pop")` and `r rtab("tab_emp")` show the MPO-level population and 
employment in each scenario by year, as well as the percent difference between
the scenarios. `r rfig("fig_population")` shows the difference between the two
scenarios across time aggregated to selected regions.

```{r tab_pop, results='asis'}
pop <- se %>% filter(var == "population")

ref <- yearly_summary(pop, "MPO", "reference")
cur <- yearly_summary(pop, "MPO", "current")
diff <- yearly_summary(pop, "MPO", "diff")

pop <- left_join(ref, cur, by = "MPO") %>%
  left_join(diff, by = "MPO")

                paste(rep(c("Reference", "Current", "Pct diff"), 
                          each = length(years)),
                      rep(years, 3)))

```

# Scenario Description

`r rtab("scenario")` shows the scenario information. 
In this report we will focus on `r facet`-level aggregations for 
`r facet_levels`. The report also provides MPO-level aggregations for all MPO's.

```{r scenario, results='asis'}
# update to reflect current scenario
scen_info <- data_frame(
  Name = c("Reference", "Current"),
  Scenario = c("Reference scenario", "Extra Floorspace"),
  `Date in S3` = c("Aug 03 16:26:07 GMT-400 2015", 
                   "")
)

kable(scen_info, caption = "Scenario Information")
```


# Population and Employment

```{r se}
se <- left_join(
  extract_se(db1, "MPO") %>% rename(reference = y),
  extract_se(db2, "MPO") %>% rename(current   = y)
) %>%
  filter(year %in% years) %>%
  mutate(diff = (current - reference) / reference * 100)
```

`r rtab("tab_pop")` and `r rfig("tab_emp")` show the MPO-level population and 
employment in each scenario by year, as well as the percent difference between
the scenarios. `r rfig("fig_population")` shows the difference between the two
scenarios across time aggregated to selected regions.

```{r tab_pop, results='asis'}
pop <- se %>% filter(var == "population")

ref <- yearly_summary(pop, "MPO", "reference")
cur <- yearly_summary(pop, "MPO", "current")
diff <- yearly_summary(pop, "MPO", "diff")

pop <- left_join(ref, cur, by = "MPO") %>%
  left_join(diff, by = "MPO")

names(pop) <- c("MPO", 
                paste(rep(c("Reference", "Current", "Pct diff"), 
                          each = length(years)),
                      rep(years, 3)))
kable(pop, caption = "Population by MPO", digits = 2)
```

```{r tab_emp, results='asis'}
emp <- se %>% filter(var == "employment")

ref <- yearly_summary(emp, "MPO", "reference")
cur <- yearly_summary(emp, "MPO", "current")
diff <- yearly_summary(emp, "MPO", "diff")

  left_join(diff, by = "MPO")

                paste(rep(c("Reference", "Current", "Pct diff"), 
                          each = length(years)),
                      rep(years, 3)))

# Transportation 

> Note that the plots in this section may only have data for years in which the 
transportation model runs.

## Volume of Travel

### VMT
```{r tab_vmt}

```


```{r plot_vmt, fig.cap="VMT by facility type."}
plot_vmt(db2, facet, facet_levels)
```

```{r compare_vmt, fig.cap="Comparison of VMT by facility type."}

```

```{r compare_vmt_mpo, fig.cap="Comparison of VMT by facility type - all MPO's."}

```

```{r compare_vht, fig.cap="Comparison of VHT by facility type."}

## Mode Split
```{r mode_share, fig.cap="Share of trips produced by mode"}
plot_trips(db2, facet, facet_levels, share = TRUE)
```

```{r mode_share_mpo, fig.cap="Share of trips produced by mode - all MPOs"}

```{r compare_mode, fig.cap="Comparison of trip productions by mode."}
compare_trips(db1, db2, facet, facet_levels)
```

```{r compare_mode_mpo, fig.cap="Comparison of trip productions by mode - all MPOs."}
compare_trips(db1, db2)
```

## Congested Links

`r rfig("fig_cong")` shows the percent of links that are congested in each
area over time by facility type. In this definition, *congested* means that
the daily volume is greater than 90% of the daily capacity.

```{r compare_cong, fig.cap="Comparison of percent link congestion."}
compare_pct_cong(db1, db2, facet, facet_levels)
```


# Economics

`r rfig("fig_floorspace")` shows the total floorspace in the area by type. 
`r rfig("fig_employment")` shows the labor output by NAICS sector in the area.

```{r fig_floorspace, fig.cap="Comparison of floorspace by type."}
compare_floorspace(db1, db2, facet, facet_levels)
```

```{r fig_employment, fig.cap="Comparison of labor output by sector."}
#compare_employment(db1, db2, facet, facet_levels)
```
